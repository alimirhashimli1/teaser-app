# Laravel Teaser App â€“ TALL Stack

This is a minimal teaser-posting application developed as part of a coding challenge. It allows users to register, log in, and create teaser posts that include a headline, text, and an image. The app is built using the TALL stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire) and follows clean architecture and Laravel best practices.
